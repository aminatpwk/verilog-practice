# Simple 16-bit ALU Design
## Overview

This project implements a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog, designed to perform basic arithmetic and logic operations on 16-bit input values. The ALU is controlled by a 3-bit operation code (`ALU_op`) and a 2-bit mode code (`mode`). The module supports operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, shift operations, and comparison.

A testbench is provided to simulate and verify the functionality of the ALU. The results of each operation are displayed, and a waveform output is generated for visualization using GTKWave.

## Features

### ALU Module (`alu.v`)
- The ALU module accepts two 16-bit inputs (`A` and `B`), a 3-bit operation selector (`ALU_op`), a 2-bit mode selector (`mode`), and a clock signal (`clk`).
- It produces a 16-bit output (`Result`) along with flags for Zero, Overflow, Negative, and Carry conditions.
- Supported operations:
  - **Addition** (`ALU_op = 000`)
  - **Subtraction** (`ALU_op = 001`)
  - **AND** (`ALU_op = 010`)
  - **OR** (`ALU_op = 011`)
  - **XOR** (`ALU_op = 100`)
  - **Shift Left** (`ALU_op = 101`)
  - **Shift Right** (`ALU_op = 110`)
  - **Less Than Comparison** (`ALU_op = 111`)

### Testbench (`alutlb.v`)
- A testbench to simulate and verify the ALU functionality.
- The testbench generates signals (`A`, `B`, `ALU_op`, `mode`, `clk`) and applies them to the ALU.
- It tests the ALU with several combinations of inputs and ALU operations and displays the results.
- A **VCD** file (`alu.vcd`) is generated to track signal changes over time, which can be visualized using GTKWave.

### Waveform Output
- The simulation produces a **VCD** file that tracks the ALUâ€™s input and output signals over time.
- You can visualize the waveform output with GTKWave to analyze the ALU's behavior during the simulation.

## File Descriptions

- **`alu.v`**: Verilog file containing the ALU module. Implements arithmetic and logic operations based on input signals and the operation code (`ALU_op`).
  
- **`alutlb.v`**: Testbench for the ALU. It sets up the clock and input signals and displays the results of ALU operations in the terminal. Also generates a **VCD** file (`alu.vcd`) for waveform visualization.

- **`alu.vcd`**: Value Change Dump (VCD) file generated by the simulation. Contains signal changes over time, and can be visualized using GTKWave.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following tools:

- **Icarus Verilog**: For compiling and simulating Verilog files.
- **GTKWave**: For visualizing the simulation output in waveform form.

### Installation

1. **Install Icarus Verilog**:
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the [Icarus Verilog website](http://iverilog.icarus.com/).

2. **Install GTKWave**:
   - Download and install GTKWave from the [GTKWave website](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).

## Running the Simulation

1. **Compile the Verilog files**:
   To compile both the ALU module and the testbench, run the following command:
   ```bash
   iverilog -o alu_tb alu.v alutlb.v
2. **Run the simulation**:
   After compiling, execute the simulation with:
   ```bash
   vvp alu_tb
3. **View the waveform output**:
   Open the alu.vcd file with GTKWave to visualize the simulation results:
   ```bash
   gtkwave alu.vcd
